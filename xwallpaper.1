.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm xwallpaper
program allows you to set image files as your X wallpaper.
PNG file format is supported by default and preferred,
but optional JPEG support exists as well.
.Pp
The wallpaper is also advertised to programs which support semi-transparent
backgrounds.
.Sh OPTIONS
The various options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl center Ar file
Centers the input file on the output.
If the dimensions of the input file are smaller than the output dimensions,
the remaining area is filled black.
If the input file dimensions are too large, parts of the image will be cropped.
.It Fl Fl clear
Initializes screen with a black background. Without this option the current
content of pseudo transparency atoms is retrieved and used as foundation.
If atom contents do not exist or cannot be reused, e.g. due to resolution
change of one of the outputs, then an initially black background is used
as well.
.It Fl Fl daemon
Keeps
.Nm xwallpaper
running in background, listening for RandR events. In this mode, the
wallpapers are redrawn when output sizes change. This option can only be used
when RandR support is available and activated.
.It Fl Fl debug
Displays debug messages on the standard error output while
.Nm xwallpaper
is running.  If used in conjunction with
.Fl Fl daemon
the process will not modify the standard input and outputs.
.It Fl Fl focus Ar file
In conjunction with
.Fl Fl trim
the specified trim box will be guaranteed to be visible on output, zooming
out if needed. If black pixels would occur around the selection, the input
image is zoomed in and moved to cover them as good as possible under the
constraint of keeping the specified trim box (or whole image if no trim box has
been specified) on output.
.It Fl Fl maximize Ar file
Maximizes input file to fit output without cropping.
This could mean zooming in or out,
depending on the dimensions of the input file and the output.
This option guarantees that the whole image is seen.
If the ratio does not fit the output, the remaining area is filled black.
The image itself will be centered on output.
.It Fl Fl no-atoms
Atoms which are used for pseudo transparency are not updated. Mutually exclusive
with
.Fl Fl no-root
option. Automatically enables
.Fl Fl clear
option.
.It Fl Fl no-randr
Ignores individual outputs and uses the whole output instead.
This is the area that spans across all different outputs (monitors).
.It Fl Fl no-root
The background of the root window is not updated. Use this option if you want
to update only atoms used for pseudo transparency. It is therefore mutually
exclusive with
.Fl Fl no-atoms
option.
.It Fl Fl trim Ar widthxheight+x+y
Specifies area of interest in source file. If output mode tries to output more
pixels than specified with trim box, then the adjacent pixels around the
box will be added to output. Black pixels are only added if no further source
pixels are left.
.It Fl Fl output Ar output
Specifies the output on which a subsequently supplied file shall be set as
wallpaper.
You can retrieve a list of outputs on your system by executing
.Xr xrandr 1 .
If no output is specified, all outputs will be modified individually.
The special keyword
.Cm all
will repeat subsequent actions on all displays.
If the output could not be found, its associated actions are ignored.
.It Fl Fl screen Ar screen
Specifies a screen by its screen number.
Normally all screens of an X display are processed.
Please note that a screen is not a single monitor.
See
.Fl Fl output
for such a use case above.
.It Fl Fl stretch Ar file
Stretches input file to fully cover the output.
If the aspect ratio of the input file does not match the output,
then the ratio of the input file is adjusted.
.It Fl Fl tile Ar file
Uses tiling mode.
Draws the input file at the upper left corner of the output
and repeats the image until the remaining area of the output is covered.
.It Fl Fl version
Prints version and exits.
.It Fl Fl zoom Ar file
Zooms input file to fit output with cropping.
This could mean zooming in or out,
depending on the dimensions of the input file and the output.
If the ratio does not fit the output,
parts of the input file will not be shown.
The image itself will be centered on output.
Default behaviour if no option was selected.
.El
.Pp
If multiple contradicting options were given, the last supplied option wins.
It is also possible to repeat output arguments without any subsequent files.
In that case, the last mode and file will be reused.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Centers a PNG file as a wallpaper on LVDS-1:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --output LVDS-1 --center file.png
.Pp
Focuses on upper left corner of a JPEG file as a wallpaper on Virtual-1:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --output Virtual-1 --trim 1x1+0+0 --focus file.jpg
.Pp
Tiles a PNG file as a wallpaper across all outputs:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --no-randr --tile file.png
.Pp
Zooms into a JPEG file as a wallpaper on each output individually:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --zoom file.jpg
.Pp
Centers and recenters a JPEG file after output updates on all outputs:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --daemon --center file.jpg
.Pp
Tiles a JPEG file as a wallpaper on VGA-1 and zooms into a PNG file on LVDS-1:
.Dl $ xwallpaper --output VGA-1 --tile file.jpg --output LVDS-1 --zoom file.png
